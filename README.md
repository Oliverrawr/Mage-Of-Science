Hi, I created this game as a test of my skill to understand and learn game development
from scratch within a short period of time. It's pretty rough so please bear with me.

The players need to use the concepts of Kinetic Energy and Force to defeat enemies.
Once all enemies are defeated you can escape the dungeon and clear the game.

Agility: Match the enemy agility to increase chances of hitting.
Rating: Match or exceed the enemy armor rating to deal damage.
Weakness: switch between Kinetic Energy or Force depending on the enemy weakness to deal damage.
